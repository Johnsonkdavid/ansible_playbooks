Ansible Vault for AWS Credentials.

- Create a vault credentials file  named filename.yml using the command 'ansible-vault create filename.yml'
- Enter a password for the vaultfile we created
- Don't forgot to note down the password, we need the password to run our playbook file

- Insert AWS Credentials into the file.The file be like;
	---
	VAULT_AWS_ACCESS_KEY:  theAwsAccessKey
	VAULT_AWS_SECRET_KEY:  theAwsSecretKey

- Inside the playbook add the 'vars_file' attribute and add the path of credentials file (filename.yml)
  (For demo purpose here I'm using an ec2 module for launching a new EC2 instance.)
   
ec2.yml
---
- name: Connection Establishment
  hosts: defaults
  gather_facts: true
  connection: local
  vars_files:
    - filename.yml                                           -------------------> give the full path to your credentials file          
  tasks:
    - name: Spinning a new EC2 instance.
      ec2:
        aws_access_key: '{{ VAULT_AWS_ACCESS_KEY }}'         -------------------> same varible which we mentioned inside filename.yml
        aws_secret_key: '{{ VAULT_AWS_SECRET_KEY }}'         -------------------> same varible which we mentioned inside filename.yml
        key_name: johnson-docker
        instance_type: t2.micro
        image: ami-********
        wait: yes
        group_id: sg-********
        region: us-east-1
        exact_count: 1
        vpc_subnet_id: subnet-******
        count_tag:
          docker-registry: 1
        instance_profile_name: (Rolename)
        user_data: "{{ lookup('file', 'userdata.sh') }}"
        instance_tags:
          Name: ECS_docker-registry
          docker-registry: 1
        assign_public_ip: yes
      register: ec2

- Run your playbook by this command, 'ansible-playbook playbookfile.yml --ask-vault-pass'
- Enter the password for vaultfile we created.
- That's it, done!!!!!
