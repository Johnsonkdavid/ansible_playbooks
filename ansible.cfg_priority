Having multiple ansible.cfg creates confusion that which one will get use, this is a genuine questio.
here is the precedence ordering starting from top to bottom.

ðŸ‘‰ $ANSIBLE_CONFIG   Setting environment variable for the location of ansible configuration file.
ðŸ‘‰ Using ./ansible.cfg   from the current directory which is used to run the ansible playbook or adhoc command
ðŸ‘‰ ~/.ansible.cfg   file present in home directory of user which is use to run the ansible command.
ðŸ‘‰ /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg  default ansible.cfg file.
IMP : Ansible will only use the configuration settings from the file which is found in this sequence first,
it will not look for the settings in the higher sequence files if the setting is not present in the file which is chosen for deployment.
